1. What is recursion?
- Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller part of a larger problem.

2. How to think?
- Think in two parts:

    1. Base case: The simplest case that stops the recursion.

    2. Recursive case: Break the problem into smaller versions and call the same function.

3. How it works?
- Each recursive call is stored in memory (call stack). It goes deeper until the base case is reached, then returns step by step, combining the results.
